## 🚀 Project Description

A React application for sending messages, designed as a WhatsApp clone. Developed as part of the Fullstack Web Development Diploma (Frontend course).

This app allows you to:
- View your contact list
- Send messages in each contact's chat
- Delete messages
- View contact details

## Final assignment requirements:

- ✅ Deployment on Vercel (or hosting of choice) functional
- ✅ Code uploaded to GitHub
- ✅ Readme.md with a description of the chosen challenge, libraries used, and difficulties encountered during resolution
- ✅ Responsive from 320px to 2000px.
- ✅ accessible styles following best practices seen in class (e.g., light backgrounds with light text are considered inaccessible).
- ✅ developed in React.
- ✅ implement state management.
- ✅ Use of contexts (optional).
- ✅ Routing must be implemented using react-router-dom.
- ✅ Must include at least 1 form.
- ✅ Must use components.
- ✅ Must have at least 2 pages in the application flow, with at least one using URL search parameters (via react-router-dom).
- ✅ Code quality following programming principles seen in class (DRY, YAGNI, KISS) will be valued.
- ✅ Pre-existing designs or pages can be used as a reference to focus less on aesthetic aspects.

## 💡 Web Development Class Feedback

First of all, I’m grateful for the positive atmosphere and the patience shown when explaining the content throughout the course.

From my personal experience, I came in with a solid foundation in HTML and CSS, and my main goal was to focus on learning JavaScript and React technologies. I felt this part of the course was a bit short and moved too quickly. As we said at many times, the 70% of learning programming comes from practice, but it’s essential to have a strong theoretical and conceptual foundation. This could be delivered through well-prepared learning materials and structured presentations during class, combined with live demonstrations using real examples that are reviewed and tested beforehand to minimize errors or omissions during the coding process.

Another area that could be improved is the time allocated for helping with system setup. A possible improvement would be to assign a tutorial as pre-class homework, then use the first half hour of the next class to address doubts or difficulties. This could be supported by recommended tutorials and additional resources (e.g., how to install Git or other version control tools, configuring VS Code, or running a React project). Then, in support classes - that I know are not mandatory and were your proposal to complement the course- the focus could be on reviewing the particular debts and providing additional help to those who need it.

Also, as you mentioned at some point during class, maybe the course content should be reviewed together with the UTN team, as it feels too dense or too complex for the expected level. I don’t think it’s ideal to include topics in the course outline—such as deeper styling techniques like Grid, or libraries like Bootstrap or Redux—if there isn’t enough time to teach them properly.

Thank you for your dedication and support throughout the course!
